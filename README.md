## Aho-Corasick_algorithm

Implementation of the Aho-Corasick automaton. 

Two functions provided: build, which takes a list of patterns and returns a built automaton, and search, which takes a machine and a text and returns a list of all the occurrences of patterns in the text (an instance is understood as the index of the beginning of a pattern in the text). 


## Graph_search_algorithms

There are two basic types of graph search algorithms: depth-first and breadth-first. The bfs and dfs methods that take the vertex from which we want to start the graph overview and allow depth-first and breadth-first search.


## Text_statistic

A function that counts the occurrence of all the words in a text file. Display of the most common words.


## Library

Write a system to support the library:
     - System operated by the console
     - The system allows you to log in (as a reader or librarian)
     - The reader can borrow a book, reserve a book that is borrowed, extend the loan, browse the catalog (search by title, author or keywords)
     - A librarian can accept a book return, add a new book, remove a book from the system, add a user (reader or librarian) and browse the catalog
     
     
## KNN_np.py & kNN_v1.py
